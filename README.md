SICP Exercises
==============

This is my own answers to the exercises in the famous SICP book

### Scheme version

I use [ChezScheme](https://github.com/cisco/ChezScheme) as the interpreter. All `*.lisp` should be able to execute by

```
$ scheme --script ex-001.lisp
```

### Filename extensions

They should be `.ss` but given atom has better support and package for `.lisp`, I will go for `.lisp` for a while.
